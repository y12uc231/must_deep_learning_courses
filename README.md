# Must Deep learning courses
I am Satya and I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University. This page has all the amazing courses that helped me learning the fundamentals and advanced concepts of machine learning and deep learning. 

[CS229](http://cs229.stanford.edu/) : Machine Learning from Stanford (Andrew Ng)

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: supervised learning (generative/discriminative learning, parametric/non-parametric learning, neural networks, support vector machines); unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, kernel methods); learning theory (bias/variance tradeoffs, practical advice); reinforcement learning and adaptive control. The course will also discuss recent applications of machine learning, such as to robotic control, data mining, autonomous navigation, bioinformatics, speech recognition, and text and web data processing.

[10-601](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10601/) Machine Learning 101 course from CMU (Multiple awesome faculties)

Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that automatically improve their performance through experience (e.g., programs that learn to recognize human faces, recommend music and movies, and drive autonomous robots). This course covers the theory and practical algorithms for machine learning from a variety of perspectives. We cover topics such as Bayesian networks, decision tree learning, Support Vector Machines, statistical learning methods, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. The course covers theoretical concepts such as inductive bias, the PAC learning framework, Bayesian learning methods, margin-based learning, and Occam’s Razor. Programming assignments include hands-on experiments with various learning algorithms. This course is designed to give a graduate-level student a thorough grounding in the methodologies, technologies, mathematics and algorithms currently needed by people who do research in machine learning.

[Intro to Reinforcement Learning by David Silver](https://deepmind.com/learning-resources/-introduction-reinforcement-learning-david-silver) 

David silver is one of the rockstars of reinforcement learning and I strongly suggest this course since it covers fundamentals and provides a good ramp to learn advanced RL. Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a powerful technique in modern machine learning, allowing a system to learn through a process of trial and error. It has been succesfully applied in many domains, including systems such as AlphaZero, that learnt to master the games of chess, Go and Shogi. This lecture series, taught at University College London by David Silver - DeepMind Principal Scienctist, UCL professor and the co-creator of AlphaZero - will introduce students to the main methods and techniques used in RL. Students will also find Sutton and Barto’s classic book, Reinforcement Learning: an Introduction a helpful companion.

[36-705 Intermediate Statistics ](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/) by Larry Wasserman

This course covers the fundamentals of theoretical statistics. Topics include: concentration of
measure, basic empirical process theory, convergence, point and interval estimation, maximum
likelihood, hypothesis testing, Bayesian inference, nonparametric statistics and bootstrap resampling. This course is excellent preparation for advanced work in Statistics and Machine Learning. Some course objectives for students in machine learning include: (1) Predict which kinds
of existing machine learning algorithms will be most suitable for which sorts of tasks, based
on formal properties and experimental results. (2) Evaluate and analyze existing learning
algorithms. There are several textbooks that we will use material from. The main textbook for the
course will be “All of Statistics” (Wasserman 2004). You can get the pdf through the library
for free. We will cover Chapters 1-12 from the text plus some supplementary material. 

[Deep Mind Deep Learning Lecture Series](https://deepmind.com/learning-resources/deep-learning-lecture-series-2020) 

These are lectures from the best in each algorithm of deep learning. These are my personal best to cover breadth and depth of any area of deep learning. Deep Learning has been applied to problems in object recognition, speech recognition, speech synthesis, forecasting, scientific computing, control and many more. The resulting applications are touching all of our lives in areas such as healthcare and medical research, human-computer interaction, communication, transport, conservation, manufacturing and many other fields of human endeavour. In recognition of this huge impact, the 2019 Turing Award, the highest honour in computing, was awarded to pioneers of Deep Learning.
